# Simple Text Imager

## What this is
This small php scripts will get text input and render it as a image

## Usage
The ``index.php`` has two forms that will call ``img1.php`` and ``img2.php`` with appropreate parameters using GET and return rendered image.

## Cache
The script will keep the hashed-filename version of the image in generated and generated2 folder

## TODO
Obviously this is a very small hack, I can extend it when I feel like it.
